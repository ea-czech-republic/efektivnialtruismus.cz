                    Too many students write theses that
                    achieve nothing other than meet the
                    requirement for the degree they are
                    seeking. When there are so many
                    important questions, in a wide range of
                    fields, that need to be answered, that's a
                    terrible waste of time and intelligent,
                    creative energy. The Effective Thesis
                    Project is seeking to change that, and I
                    hope it will.
                    The Effective Thesis project is a great way
                    to make high-impact research areas more
                    visible to university students...This would
                    have an outsized social impact -
                    especially because the Effective Thesis
                    project has carefully selected its
                    suggested topics based on cutting-edge
                    research from the emerging field of global
                    priorities research.
